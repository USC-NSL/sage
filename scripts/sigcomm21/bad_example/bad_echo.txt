   IP Fields:

   Addresses

      The address of the source in an echo message will be the
      destination of the echo reply message.  To form an echo reply
      message, the source and destination addresses are simply reversed,
      the type code changed to 0, and the checksum recomputed. The Data is bad.

   IP Fields:

   Type

      8 for echo message;

      0 for echo reply message.

   Code

      0

   Checksum

      The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's
      complement sum of the ICMP message starting with the ICMP Type.
      For computing the checksum, the checksum field should be zero.
      For computing the checksum, if the total length is odd, the
      received data is padded with one octet of zeros.  This checksum
      may be replaced in the future.

   Identifier

      If code = 0, an identifier may be zero to help match
      echos and replies.


   Sequence Number



      If code = 0, a sequence number may be zero to help match
      echos and replies.

   Description

      The data received in the echo message must be returned in the echo
      reply message.

      The identifier and sequence number may be used by the echo sender
      to aid in matching the replies with the echo requests.  For
      example, the identifier might be used like a port in TCP or UDP to
      identify a session, and the sequence number might be incremented
      on each echo request sent.  The echoer returns these same values
      in the echo reply.

      Code 0 may be received from a gateway or a host.
