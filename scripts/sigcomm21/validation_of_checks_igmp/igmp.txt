      Type

         There are two types of IGMP message of concern to hosts

         1 = Host Membership Query,

         2 = Host Membership Report.

      Unused

         Unused field is zeroed when sent. Unused field is ignored when received.

      Checksum

         The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's
         complement sum of the IGMP message.  For computing
         the checksum, the checksum field is zero.

      Group Address

         For a Host Membership Query message, the group address field
         is zeroed when sent. The group address field is ignored when received.

         For a Host Membership Report message, the group address field
         holds the IP host group address of the group being reported.

      Description

         The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is used by IP hosts to
         report their host group memberships to any immediately-neighboring
         multicast routers.  IGMP is an asymmetric protocol and is specified
         here from the point of view of a host, rather than a multicast
         router.  (IGMP may also be used, symmetrically or asymmetrically,
         between multicast routers.  Such use is not specified here.)

         Like ICMP, IGMP is a integral part of IP.  It is required to be
         implemented by all hosts conforming to level 2 of the IP multicasting
         specification.  IGMP messages are encapsulated in IP datagrams, with
         an IP protocol number of 2.  All IGMP messages of concern to hosts
         have the following format:
