State machine	
	If the Vers field is not 1 , the packet MUST be
	discarded.

	If the Length field is less than 24, the packet MUST be
	discarded.

	If the Length field is greater than the payload of the
	encapsulating protocol, the packet MUST be discarded.

	If the Detect Mult field is zero, the packet MUST be discarded.

	If the M field is not zero, the packet MUST be
	discarded.

	If the My Discriminator field is zero, the packet MUST be
	discarded.

	If the Your Discriminator field is not zero, Your Discriminator field MUST be used to
	select the session with which the packet is associated.

	If the Your Discriminator field is not zero and the session with which the packet is associated is not found, the packet MUST be discarded.

	If the Your Discriminator field is zero and the State field is not
	Down or AdminDown, the packet MUST be discarded.

	If the A_field is set and bfd.AuthType
	is zero, the packet MUST be discarded.

	If the A_field is clear and bfd.AuthType
	is not zero, the packet MUST be discarded.

	bfd.RemoteDiscr is set to the value of My Discriminator field.

	bfd.RemoteState is set to the value of the Sta_field.

	bfd.RemoteDemandMode is set to the value of the D_field.

	bfd.RemoteMinRxInterval is set to the value of Required Min RX
	Interval field.

	If the Required Min Echo RX Interval field is zero, the
	transmission of Echo packets MUST cease.

	If a Poll Sequence is being transmitted by the local system and the F_field in the received packet is set, the Poll Sequence MUST be terminated.

	The local system updates the transmit interval.
	
	The local system updates the Detection Time.
	
	If bfd.RemoteDemandMode is 1 and bfd.SessionState is Up and
	bfd.RemoteSessionState is Up, the local system MUST cease the transmission
	of BFD Control packets.

	If bfd.RemoteDemandMode is 0 or bfd.SessionState is not Up or 
	bfd.RemoteSessionState is not Up, the local system MUST periodically send BFD Control
	packets.
